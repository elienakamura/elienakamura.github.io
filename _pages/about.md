Welcome to my website. I am currently working as a Ph.D Student at the Research Team in Social Epidemiology from Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidémiologie et de Santé Publique, INSERM & Sorbonne Université. My thesis is entitled *The role of Social support during pregnancy in social inequalities with regards to parental postpartum depression* and is supervied by Maria Melchior (Research Director at INSERM) and Judith van der Waerden (Research Associate at INSERM). In addition to my Ph.D, I am working as a Teaching Assistant in Statistics at the Statistics and Business Intelligence (STID), IUT Paris Descartes. 

You can dowload my [resume] and a full list of my [publications]. 


A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).



More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
